<h1>Bankroll :moneybag:</h1>

<h2>A banking website created using react and style components.</h2>

<p>This project is created using React. I created this following the tutorial of Brian Design. I've changed the images, color scheme, added an icon, changed the color of the video, and values of measure. This project was the fun to build and to use svg images as this was the first time that I used svg images. Beginner friendly project.</p>
